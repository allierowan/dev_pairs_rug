# RUG Pair Coding Challenge: Dev Pairs

The challenge was to build a simple app to partner up programmers for a pair-programming session. The ideal pairs are made up of programmers of different experience levels, juniors with mids and mids with seniors if possible. The program also had to handle odd numbers.
